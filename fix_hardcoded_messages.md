## candidates/admin.py
21-24. Lines 138-156: Email notification messages (admin only, lower priority)

## Strategy
- Wrap each message with `_()` function
- For f-strings with variables, use `%` formatting: `_('text %(var)s') % {'var': value}`
- For error messages with exceptions, use: `_('Message: %(error)s') % {'error': str(e)}`
